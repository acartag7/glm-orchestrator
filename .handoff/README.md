# Spec-Driven Development - Handoff Directory

This directory contains specifications and implementation plans.

## Current

- `spec-driven-dev-mvp.md` - **Active MVP specification**

## Archive

Old specs from previous iterations are in `archive/`:
- `v2-architecture.md` - MCP server approach (superseded)
- `session-lifecycle.md` - Session management spec (future)
- `workflow-visualization.md` - n8n-style view (future)
- `feature-*.md` - Old feature specs

## Workflow

1. Write spec in this directory
2. Implement from spec
3. Archive when complete or superseded
